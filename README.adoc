:fn-reusability: footnote:[This is a nice-to-have, as opposed to a hard goal]

A work-in-progress look at a more phased approach to how Hibernate reads annotation
and XML based mapping information.  Specifically here we are looking at the process
used to build the `org.hibernate.mapping` model - the so-called boot model.

There are a few inter-related goals for this work -

1. More phased approach compared to the current "second pass" approach
2. Replace HCANN with Jandex for low-level annotation reading
3. Extended orm.xml support (drop hbm.xml)
4. Better leverage of "temp class loader"
5. Re-usability across projects{fn-reusability}
